# Cupholder Paperclip Caddy
Combination paperclip caddy and pen/pencil holder. I wanted something sized to fit inside a car cupholder and looked nice enough to sit out on a desk.

The outside diameter is about 66mm, roughly the same as a 12oz drink can. The front lip has 3 indentations for inserting magnets. The pen/pencil holder will hold any writing utensil up to about 14mm in diameter.


# Optional Components
3x 6mm diameter by 3mm tall neodymium magnets. They will need to be glued in place.
