# Coin Display and Keychain
Customizer ready models for displaying, protecting, or making a keychain fob out of coins (or other coin-like items).

# Generating the STL
Open .scad files in OpenSCAD, use the customizer to modify the model to your needs (see screenshots).

Render (F6) and then Export As STL (F7).

If the customizer doesn't open by default it can be opened by going to View and unticking the Hide Customizer check box.
