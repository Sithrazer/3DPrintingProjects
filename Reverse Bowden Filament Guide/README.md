# Reverse Bowden Filament Guide
Creates a fixed length PTFE 'bowden tube' bridge from a filament spool/drybox to a direct drive extruder.

The mounts are sized for the push connect fittings to cut their own threads. It is possible to thread the fittings in far enough to be secure by hand. If you use a wrench, take care not to strip the plastic.

Use a little bit (or a lot) of caulk or other sealant to fill any gaps on the drybox container. Be careful not to get any in the push connect fitting or bowden tube.

Feeding filament into the extruder can be a little bit trickier with this setup, but I find detaching the bowden tube from the extruder end and feeding from above the push connect fitting works rather well. Same for clearing clogs, detach the bowden tube and pull the filament from above the fitting.

# BOM
(required)
1x Extruder End (printed)
1x Drybox End (printed)
2x 'PC4-M10' Push-to-Connect fittings (fits 4mm OD tubing with M10 threads)
4x M4-12 bolts (For Anet A8/clone, hardware requirements will differ across printers)
4x M4-8 bolts
4x M4 nuts
2 meters PTFE tube for 1.75mm filament (2mm ID/4mm OD)
1 container to serve as the drybox
(optional)
Sealant/caulk
Dessicant


# Assembly
Screw your PC4-M10 push connect fittings into the drybox and extruder end mounts.
 
Use the M4-12 bolts to mount the extruder end to your X-carriage above the extruder as seen in the gallery. (Anet A8/clone)
 
Mark and pre-drill your holes in your drybox. Don't forget the center hole for the filament.
 
Use the M4-8 bolts taken from the X-carriage and the M4 nuts to mount the drybox end to your drybox. Use caulk/sealant as necessary.
 
Measure and cut a length of PTFE bowden tube and push each end into the push connect fittings.
 
Place your spool holder and filament into the drybox, feed the filament through the bowden tube and into the extruder.
